    "# Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstarct\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this project we intend to implement a deep convolutional neural network architecture proposed by [1], propose variantes derived from the latter architecture and study the influce of each hyperparemeter on the performance of the network. As a bonus we intend to embed our best model into a pc application that translates a sequence of sign language caracters into text. This appears to be of a great utility considering that this may present the first step towards a real time translator on smartphones that we intend to implement beyond the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Language translation is one of the core AI tasks. AI systems have reached an interesting performance when dealing with various spoken and written languages and translating them mutually to each other. \n",
    "An important form of language well spread yet not sufficiently treated is the sign language. More than 360 million people around the world use sign language to communicate with each other or to translate from/to other languages. <br>\n",
    "Automating the task of translating form or to sign language appears then to be a perfect application of Deep Learning solutions. In fact many research institutions and companies have tried to offer deep learning based solutions but as far as we know, no official paper implementations have been published.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we try then to implement a proposed solution by \"Vivek and Dianna\" from the \"State University of New York at Buffalo\" in their paper \"Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Gesture Recognition in American Sign Language\". Since an official implementation has not been published, we consider implementing the proposed architecture and reproducing the results to familiarize our selves with deep learning frameworks. We then intend to propose other variants of the architecture and study their influence on the network's performance.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal is then description of what we intend to do during this project and contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. description of the used Data Set\n",
    "2. details about the baseline architecture \n",
    "3. the set hyperparameters variation that we intend to study\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set used in this project will be the \"MUHandImagesASL\", made publically available by the Massey University[2]. The dataset is based on American Sign Language hand gestures. The particularity of this dataset lies on covering large variety of hands, dialects and illumination conditions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 2425 images of 5 individuals divided in 5 separated folders, one for each volunteer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "for the task of classifying sign Language, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used.  CNNs have been extremely \n",
    "successful in image recognition and classification problems, and have been successfully implemented for human gesture \n",
    "recognition in recent years [reference paper].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "The implemented architecture consists of a CNN with multiple convolutional and dense layers followed by a max-pool layer\n",
    "and a dropout layer and two groups of fully connected layer followed by a drop-out layer and one final output layer \n",
    "![cnn](cnn.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make use of random hyper-parameter optimization to determine the best parameters for this architecture and \n",
    "benchmark the results with the published accuracy values.\n",
    "The set of parameters we will cover in this search are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of layers\n",
    "* Density of layers\n",
    "* The drop-out rate\n",
    "* Learning rate of the optimizer\n",
    "* The regularization term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, we will compare different optimizers and different loss-functions.  Finally, we will compare the effect of\n",
    "using batch-normalization in comparison to setting a dropout-rate\n",
    "\n",
